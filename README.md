# GoodsendAppTestCode
This repo contains the test code for the Goodsend beneficiary portal and administrator database. It was built using Flask and Python. Stripe and a Sendgrid APIs were also incorporated.

The goal of this application is to automate a lot of the processes the founder of GOODSendApp is currently doing manually. It consists of a datbase that can be controlled from the browser by the Admin and allows beneficiaries of the nonprofit to be able to create an account and login to see their beneficiary status. 

It is currently deployed at https://goodsendapp.herokuapp.com/
